            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY VERY LOVING FRIENDS, THE VICE-CHANCELLOVR, THE DOCTORS, THE PROCTORS, <hi>AND</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the <hi>Vniverſity</hi> of OXFORD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter my hearty Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations &amp;c. Theſe are to remember my love to that whole Body. That love, than which never any Chancellour bare greater, or with more ferventneſſe and zeale to the publique good and happines of that Place.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93564:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->And I doe heartily pray all, and every of you to believe me, for moſt true it is, that the unfortunateneſſe of my great affliction doth not trouble mee for any one thing more, then that I can be no farther uſefull or beneficiall to that Place, which I ſo much love and honour.</p>
            <p>I was once reſolved not to reſigne my Place of Chancellour, till I ſaw the iſſue of my troubles one way or other. And this reſolution I took, partly becauſe I had no reaſon to deſert my Selfe, and occaſion the World to think me guilty: And partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have found ſo much love from the Univerſity that I could not make my ſelfe willing to leave it, till ſome greater Cauſe ſhould take me off from that which I ſo reſolved on.</p>
            <p>That Cauſe (if I be not much miſtaken,) doth now preſent it ſelfe. For I ſee the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity hath great need of Friends, great and dayly need. I ſee my triall not haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that I am neither able to asſiſt your great occaſions my ſelf nor procure Friends
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93564:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->for them: I ſee that if you had another Chancellour you could not want the helpe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> now you doe. And I cannot but know that were your love never ſo great to me, it muſt needs cool, when you ſee me able to give no Asſiſtance, and yet fill the Place which ſhould afford it to you. And I ſhould hardly ſatisfy my ſelfe, that I love you ſo well as I doe, if I did not further your Good and happineſſe by all the meanes I can, and even by this my Reſignation.</p>
            <p>The ſerious conſideration of theſe things, and the foreſight which I have, that I ſhall never be able to ſerve you as I have done, have prevailed with me at this time, to ſend the Reſignation of the Chancellour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to your Body met in Convocation. And doe hereby pray you that it may bee publikely read and accepted, the time being now moſt fit, that ſo your Honourable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chancellour may preſently appoint an able Deputy for the Government accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne judgement.</p>
            <p>And now I doe earneſtly deſire of you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93564:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->all, either to remember, or to know, that I never ſought, or thought of the Honour of this Place to my ſelfe: And yet that ſince it was by the great favour and love of that Univerſity laid upon me, I have diſcharged it (by Gods grace and goodneſſe to mee) with great paines and care, and Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (I humbly thank him,) hath not been wanting. And I profeſſe ſingly and from my heart, if there be any Good which I ought to have done to that Place, and have not done it, it proceeded from want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or ability, not Will or affection. And though I doe for the Cauſes aforeſaid reſigne this Place, yet I ſhall ſerve it ſtill with my Prayers, ſo long as God continues my life.</p>
            <p>And as J doubt not but God will bleſſe you with an Honourable Chancellour, and one able to doe more for that Place than J have been; ſo J pray God to give you a peaceable and quiet Election, and to direct it to the Good of this his Church, and the honour and happineſſe of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
